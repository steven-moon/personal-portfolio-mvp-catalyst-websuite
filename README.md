# Personal Portfolio Project

A modern, full-stack personal portfolio application with a React TypeScript frontend and Node.js Express backend. This project showcases a complete web application featuring a portfolio, blog, admin dashboard, and more.

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project consists of two main components:

1. **Frontend**: A modern React application with TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui components featuring neumorphic design
2. **Backend**: A secure Node.js Express API with Sequelize ORM, MySQL database, and JWT authentication

## 📋 Main Features

- **Modern Portfolio Showcase**: Display projects, skills, and personal information
- **Blog System**: Create and share articles and insights
- **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based authentication and role-based access control
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage content, blog posts, and projects
- **Responsive Design**: Works across all devices and screen sizes
- **API Integration**: Structured API for all data operations
- **Neumorphic UI**: Soft, elegant user interface with subtle shadows and transitions

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - React 18+ with TypeScript
  - Vite for fast builds
  - TailwindCSS for styling
  - shadcn/ui components
  - React Router for navigation

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js with Express
  - Sequelize ORM
  - MySQL database
  - JWT authentication
  - Structured API endpoints

## 🚀 Getting Started

The project is split into two parts, each with its own setup process:

### Frontend Setup

For detailed frontend setup instructions, see the [Frontend README](/frontend/README.md).

### Backend Setup

For detailed backend setup and API documentation, see the [Backend README](/backend/README.md).

### Docker Setup

You can also run the entire application using Docker, which sets up both the frontend and backend with a single command:

#### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) 
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (usually included with Docker Desktop)

#### Running with Docker Compose

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
   This command will build and start all services defined in the docker-compose.yml file.

2. **Start in detached mode** (run in background):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Stop the application**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

4. **Rebuild containers** (after making changes to Dockerfiles):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

5. **View logs**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs
   ```
   
   Or for a specific service:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs frontend
   ```

#### Accessing the Application

- Frontend: http://localhost:9090
- Backend API (via Nginx): http://localhost:9090/api
- Backend API (direct access): http://localhost:3000
- Database (MySQL): localhost:3306

#### Database Initialization

When you first start the application with Docker Compose, the system will:

1. Set up the MySQL database with the required schema
2. Run seeders to populate the database with sample data including:
   - Admin user
   - Site settings
   - Home page content
   - About page with work experience, education, and skills
   - Sample projects and tags
   - Blog posts and categories
   - Contact information

This process happens automatically when the containers start up. You'll see seeding logs in the backend container output.

If you need to manually re-seed the database:

```bash
# Access the backend container
docker-compose exec backend sh

# Run the seeders script
node src/scripts/run-seeders.js

# Exit the container
exit
```

#### Environment Variables

You can customize the setup by setting these environment variables:
- `HOST_PORT`: The port to access the frontend application via Nginx (default: 9090)
- `API_PORT`: The port to access the backend API directly (default: 3000)
- `HOST_DB_PORT`: The port to access the database from the host (default: 3306)

Example:
```bash
HOST_PORT=8000 API_PORT=4000 docker-compose up
```

#### Connecting External Tools

- **API Testing Tools (like RapidAPI)**: Connect to http://localhost:3000
- **Database Tools (like Navicat)**:
  - Host: localhost
  - Port: 3306
  - User: portfolio_user
  - Password: portfolio_password
  - Database: portfolio_db

## 🤖 Cursor Rules for AI

This project uses Cursor's Rules for AI feature to maintain consistent coding standards, architecture, and development practices. The rules are structured in a hierarchical way:

- **Root-level `.cursor`**: Project-wide guidelines and references to component rules
- **`/frontend/.cursorrulesrulesrulesrulesrulesrules`**: Frontend development rules for React, TypeScript, and UI
- **`/backend/.cursorrules`**: Backend rules for Express, Sequelize, and API design

These rules help ensure consistency across the codebase and guide AI assistants in following project conventions. For more information, see:

- [Root-level Cursor Rules](/.cursorrules)
- [Frontend Cursor Rules](/frontend/.cursorrules)
- [Backend Cursor Rules](/backend/.cursorrules)
